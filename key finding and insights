 Summary of Findings for Alt Mobility



1.Sales and Order Growth:  
   Alt Mobility has seen steady growth in both the number of orders and total sales revenue over time, with notable seasonal spikes around certain months. The average order value has remained stable, indicating consistent customer purchasing behavior.

2. Order Fulfillment Performance:  
   The overall fulfillment rate is strong, ranging between 88% to 92%. However, slight dips during peak seasons suggest the need for better operational planning to handle high order volumes without affecting delivery performance.

3. Payment System Efficiency:
   Payment success rates are consistently high (over 95%), with only minor failures mostly caused by card declines or timeouts. UPI and credit cards are the most commonly used payment methods, showing a shift towards digital transactions.

4. Customer Retention and Lifetime Value:
   Approximately 65% of customers are returning buyers, reflecting strong loyalty. However, customers acquired through promotions tend to churn faster. High-value customers (top 10%) contribute a major portion of revenue, highlighting the importance of segmenting and nurturing these groups.

5. Key Recommendations:  
   To sustain and accelerate growth, Alt Mobility should focus on improving early repeat purchase rates (within the first 30 days), scale fulfillment operations during seasonal peaks, optimize the checkout experience to further boost payment success, and launch targeted retention programs for high-value customers.
